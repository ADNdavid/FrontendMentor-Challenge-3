## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Use **Semantic Tags** in HTML structure.

- Use the properties **grid-template-areas** and **grid-area** to center a tag that contains the card.

- Use the property **transform: translate(-50%, -50%)** to change the position of the axis point of the icon.

- Use the properties **position: relative** and **position: absolute** to put a transparent blue square above the main image when you hover on it.
